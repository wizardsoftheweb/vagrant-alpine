Otherwise known as generic ARM

## Dependencies

* `qemu`: In order for this to run, `qemu` must have ARM support.

    ```
    $ qemu-system-arm
    zsh: command not found: qemu-system-arm
    ```
    You may be able to get away with vanilla repos.
    ```
    sudo apt-get install -y qemu qemu-system-arm
    ```
    Compare the last of provided machines with the machines `u-boot` supports for a good measure.
    ```
    qemu-system-arm -machine help
    ```

    If you're a glutton for punishment like me, you [can build from source](https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation).

    We'll also need `qemu-arm-static` which can be installed or built.
